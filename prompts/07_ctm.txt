Now, will start with the generation of the composite activity definitions for city transport management (CTM). First, we will present the events and input fluents. Second, we will provide the composite activity definitions in natural language and ask for their specification in the language of RTEC.

Given the description below, provide the rules in the language of RTEC. You may use the built-in events of RTEC, the CTM events, and the CTM input fluents. You may also use any of the CTM output fluents, i.e. the fluents that we will define together.

Description - "internal_temperature": We aim to determine the internal temperature of a vehicle. The internal temperature of a vehicle starts to be: (1) very warm, (2) warm, (3) normal, (4) cold, or (5) very cold when a corresponding “internal temperature change” is detected.

Description - "noise_level": We aim to determine the noise level inside a vehicle. The noise level inside a vehicle starts to be: (1) low, (2) normal, or (3) high when a corresponding noise level change is detected.

Description - "punctuality": We aim to assess the punctuality of a vehicle. A vehicle starts to be considered punctual when it enters a stop (1) earlier than planned, or (2) exactly on schedule. A vehicle starts to be considered non-punctual when it (1) enters a stop later than planned, or (2) leaves a stop earlier than scheduled.

Description - "driving_style": We aim to assess the driving style of a vehicle. The driving style may be classified as unsafe or uncomfortable. First, the driving style of a vehicle is considered unsafe as long as the vehicle is taking a very sharp turn, or undergoing a very abrupt acceleration or a very abrupt deceleration. Second, the driving style of a vehicle is considered uncomfortable as long as the vehicle is taking a sharp turn without a very abrupt acceleration or deceleration, or when the vehicle accelerates or decelerates abruptly.

Description - "driving_quality": We aim to assess the driving quality of a vehicle. The driving quality of a vehicle may be classified as high, medium, or low. First, the driving quality of a vehicle is considered high as long as the vehicle is punctual, while neither an unsafe nor an uncomfortable driving style is in progress. Second, the driving quality of a vehicle is considered medium as long as the vehicle is punctual, but the driving style has dipped to uncomfortable. Third, the driving quality of a vehicle is considered low as long as the vehicle is non-punctual or its driving style is outright unsafe.

Description - "passenger_comfort": We aim to assess the passenger’s comfort level inside a vehicle. The passenger’s comfort inside a vehicle is considered to be reducing as long as the vehicle is being driven uncomfortably, the driving style is unsafe, the passenger density is high, the noise level is high, or the internal temperature is very warm or very cold.
