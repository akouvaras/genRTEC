Prompt VP:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Now, we will start with the specification of the multi-agent voting protocol procedure (VP). First, we will present the events. Second, we will present the predicates expressing the background knowledge. Third, we will provide the protocol rules in natural language and ask for their specification in the language of RTEC. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Prompt VP-Events:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In addition to the built-in events of RTEC, you may use the following VP events:

VP - Event 1: propose(Ag, M)
Meaning: An agent “Ag” proposes a motion “M”.

VP - Event 2: second(Ag, M)
Meaning: An agent “Ag” seconds a motion “M”.

VP - Event 3: vote(Ag, M, aye)
Meaning: An agent “Ag” casts an “aye” vote “V” on motion “M”. 

VP - Event 4: vote(Ag, M, nay)
Meaning: An agent “Ag” casts a “nay” vote “V” on motion “M”. 

VP - Event 5: close_ballot(Ag, M)
Meaning: An agent “Ag” closes the ballot for motion “M”. 

VP - Event 6: declare(Ag, M, carried)
Meaning: An agent “Ag” declares that motion “M” is carried. 

VP - Event 7: declare(Ag, M, not_carried)
Meaning: An agent “Ag” declares that motion “M” is not carried.

You may also use the following VP background knowledge predicate. 

VP Background Knowledge - Predicate 1: role_of(C,chair)
Meaning: An agent “C” holds the role of chair.

Prompt VP-R1:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Given the description below, provide the rules in the language of RTEC. You may use the built-in events of RTEC, the VP events, and the VP background knowledge predicate. You may also use any of the VP output fluents, i.e. the fluents that we will define together.

Description - “status”: We aim to determine the status of a motion. By default, every motion’s status is null. First, a motion’s status becomes proposed when an agent proposes the motion, provided that the status of the motion is null. Second, the status changes to voting when an agent seconds the motion that was previously proposed. Third, the status becomes voted when the agent occupying the role of the chair closes the ballot on the motion that was in voting status. Fourth, the status returns to null when the agent occupying the role of the chair declares the outcome of the motion that was in voted status. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Prompt VP-R2:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Given the description below, provide the rules in the language of RTEC. You may use the built-in events of RTEC, the VP events, and the VP background knowledge predicate. You may also use any of the VP output fluents, i.e. the fluents that we will define together.

Description - “voted”: We aim to record the way each agent has voted. Casting a vote, i.e., aye or nay, is recorded provided that the status of the motion in question is voting. An agent’s vote is set to null when a new voting round begins, i.e., when the status of the motion becomes null. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Prompt VP-R3:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Given the description below, provide the rules in the language of RTEC. You may use the built-in events of RTEC, the VP events, and the VP background knowledge predicate. You may also use any of the VP output fluents, i.e. the fluents that we will define together.

Description - “outcome”: We aim to record the outcome of the voting procedure concerning a motion. The outcome of the voting procedure, i.e., carried or not carried is declared by the agent occupying the role of the chair, provided that the status of the motion in question is voted. The outcome of the voting procedure is considered to stop being carried or not carried when the status of a motion starts being proposed. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Prompt VP-R4:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Given the description below, provide the rules in the language of RTEC. You may use the built-in events of RTEC, the VP events, and the VP background knowledge predicate. You may also use any of the VP output fluents, i.e. the fluents that we will define together.

Description - “pow”: We aim to identify the conditions in which agents have the institutional power to perform specific actions concerning a motion. First, an agent is empowered to propose a motion as long as the status of the motion is null. Second, an agent is empowered to second a motion as long as the status of the motion is proposed. Third, an agent is empowered to cast a vote as long as the status of the motion is voting. Fourth, the agent occupying the role of the chair is empowered to close the ballot as long as the status of the motion is voting. Fifth, the chair is empowered to declare the voting outcome for the motion as long as the status of the motion is voted.
